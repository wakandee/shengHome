    <h2>About Sheng Translator</h2>
    <p>
        Sheng Translator was born from a deep love for Kenyan street culture and the desire to bridge the communication gap across generations. Inspired by the vibrant mix of Swahili, English, and local dialects that make up Sheng, I wanted to preserve and share this evolving language with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, I watched Sheng develop into more than just street slang—it became a cultural movement. I felt it was important to document and translate Sheng so that it could be accessible to anyone, from language enthusiasts to tourists interested in this unique urban language.
